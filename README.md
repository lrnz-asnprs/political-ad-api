# Political ad analysis

Data analysis research project 

## Description

This project aims to analyze how US politicians talk about climate change on Facebook owned social media advertisements. We are leveraging Facebook's Ad Library, that has been released in May 2018, to answer important questions about social media advertisement strategies in regards to climate change.
